  "summary": "This document outlines testing methods for code injection vulnerabilities, focusing on web applications that process user input as dynamic code or included files. It describes black box and gray box testing approaches, such as using query strings to inject malicious URLs in PHP and examining ASP code for command execution. The goal is to identify potential security risks and ensure proper input validation and secure coding practices.",
